# City Watch City Skins
Adds new skins for the city watch buildings and their smaller amenities versions that have stone ground textures better suited to cities.

These skins also allow placing ground tiles over them to further customise their look*. (See the following section for details)

## Issues with Ground Tile Layering
The game currently has some inconsistencies with how it decides to layer textures on the ground when they overlap.

When you first swap a building to a city skin and try to place flagstone or any other "low" height ground tiling over it you may find it doesn't work and is placed underneath the building's ground texture instead. "High" ground tiles will normally always draw over the ground textures.

Low height textures are the grass/dirt/mud/flagstone in the base game or any of the dynamic variants in my additional flagstones mod. High textures are the rest of the ground tiles in the base game including all the mosaics, or the tiled variants in my additional flagstones mod.

This issue is usually fixed by saving and then fully restarting the game. For some reason this seems to change the draw ordering and allows the ground tiles to go over the buildings ground texture properly.

I have spent a lot of time trying to fix this or even pin down a specific reason for why it happens but there seems to be several factors involved and I don't think it's something I can actually fix on the mod side.

## Some Plants Have Been Removed
It was necessary to remove a few plants since bushes and trees don't normally grow on densely paved ground. Most notable was the tree and bushes behind the main medici building. It's a very small area when there's a road against the back of the building so I decided not to try and add a garden bed there.

## Extra Compatibility with City Watch Terracotta Roof Skins
An extra variant of the relevant skins will be added if City Watch Terracotta Roof Skins is installed.

Note that compatibility is based on the mod folder being installed and NOT what is activated in your active-profile.txt.
